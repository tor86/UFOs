**Overview of Project:**

Taking data that is stored as JavaScript array or list and create a table to sort and organize the information and making a webpage with a dynamic table of UFO sightings. The table can be filtered for users to find results based on various criteria options with an output of a descriptive table.
Using JavaScript, HMTL, Bootstrap and CSS to work with the data as well as build the webpage.

**Results:**

When the user opens the page they will see 5 boxes for input regarding UFO Sightings as well as a few paragraphs to ask the pose the question on if they believe in the UFO Sightings encouraging them to sort through the data of sightings in the United States. They will be able to enter the Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the sighting. The output will show the user not only the data from the search criteria but also the duration of the sighting and comments from the sighting.

**Summary:**
---
---

One drawback of the new design is the visual flow of the table, the all lower case and no separation between columns makes the table not the easiest to read and not being able to sort the table by column.
In further development making the table easier to read as well as adding a sort feature for the columns would make webpage more user friendly. 
Another addition that would help is using a live website that is updated as well as stores historical data so the users are able to find more recent relevant data in regards to UFO sightings in the United States, could also add for more global searches.
